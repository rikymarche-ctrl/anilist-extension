## Overview

Anilist Hover Comments enhances your Anilist experience by displaying user comments when hovering over entries in the "Following" section of anime and manga pages. No need to click through user profiles‚Äîsee what your friends think instantly!

The extension is designed to be lightweight and respectful of Anilist's API, using an intelligent caching system to minimize requests while still providing up-to-date information. It stays out of your way until you need it.

## Features

- View user comments directly from anime/manga pages with a simple hover
- Smart detection: Comment icons appear only for users who left notes
- Advanced caching system prevents excessive API requests to Anilist
- Lightweight impact ensures browsing feels seamless and responsive
- Smooth animations and responsive tooltip positioning
